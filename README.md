The default WooCommerce colour styles in Divi are very basic. Currently, there are no customisation options for buttons, notifications, product sale badges etc. This can become an issue when you are trying to achieve brand consistency across a website.

Now, imagine if you could…

* Change the text size, colour, line spacing, background colour, border radius and more of your WooCommerce Buttons. How about changing the button background and text colour on hover?
* Change the background and text colour of your WooCommerce Alert Messages.
* Change the background and text colour of your WooCommerce Sale Badges.
