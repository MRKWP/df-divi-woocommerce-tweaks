#WooCommerce Colours For Divi

The default WooCommerce colour styles support in Divi is basic. Style customization options for **WooCommerce buttons, notification messages, product sale badge** etc don't exist. Clients want brand consistency for their website. With the customers short attention span, it's imperative to create a lasting impression.

Imagine if you can

* Change text size, colour, line spacing, background color, border radisu and more of **Add To Cart**, **Apply Coupon**, **Update Cart**, **Proceed to Checkout**, **Place Order** WooCommerce buttons.  How about background and text colour changes on button hover?
* Change background and text colour of the **WooCommerce notification messages**.
* Change background and text colour of the **Product Sale Badge**.
